[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/df186628984846f9a5e9c066e748e70f)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/boehs/Warbler/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=boehs/Warbler&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Bot with a focus on graded incremental punishments over conventional moderation commands.

---

Warbler is my unique mod bot. Instead of normal ban, mute, and other commands, she applies punishments based on a users "point number"

a mod can apply a number of points to a member, and if they get punished again it's `former points + points given = new point num = what type of punishment the member gets`.

She also has other stuff I wish most modbots had like /hush - mutes the entire channel, and built in modmail

She is also super friendly, and has a set of punish templates a server can set, `say @mod used give @bob 1 points, it was very effective!`
